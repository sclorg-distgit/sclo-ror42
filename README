Package %{scl_name} provides Ruby on Rails web framework delivered as
a Software Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working
Ruby on Rails framework.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'ruby'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

Ruby on Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby that includes
everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

To enable Java Script support in your Ruby on Rails application, please use
%{scl} collection in conjunction with node.js or alternatively therubyracer gem
together with v8 collection.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'rails new APP_PATH'
  The 'rails new' command creates a new Rails application with a default
  directory structure and configuration at the path you specify by Ruby on
  Rails generator from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.
